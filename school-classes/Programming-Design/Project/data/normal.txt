I love pizza.
Open the door.
Close the window.
It is raining.
She is happy.
I have a dog.
We are friends.
This is a pen.
He runs fast.
Don't be late.
Time is money.
It's very cold.
Turn off the light.
Give me a book.
I like music.
This is easy.
Let's go now.
It is sunny.
You are right.
Come with me.
It's over there.
Do your best.
Be on time.
Take a rest.
Please sit down.
Have a nice day.
Wake up early.
I am so tired.
Look at that.
